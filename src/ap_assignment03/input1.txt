Write a command line program that reads files as arguments form the user where each file contains some English text. For each File you are required to make a separate thread and the name of the thread should be same as the filename. All files should be processed in parallel (multi-Threading).
Your program will be test like this:
java MyProgram.java vocabulary.txt inputfile1.txt inputfile2.txt ……….
• Vocabulary file contain words used to form English sentences
• Input Files contain English sentences
In this case Your program will create three threads named as vocabulary, input1, and input2 respectively.
Main thread of the program will work as a console-based UI through which user will interact with your program.
Description:
• Your Program displays the number of files and name of the files input.
• Read the vocabulary file and build a binary search tree from the read file.
• Read the input files, tokenize each files sentence into words and store them in temporary collection (vector etc.).
• Match each word of files in binary search tree and if match found, create instances of class word for each matched word.
• For more than one occurrence of same word increment the frequency of that word.
• Prompt the user to enter a query and check whether there exists a match file or not.
• Display the relevant messages, which shows how many words of query exists in files, number of matches found in each file, which file has a proper match in term of numbers matched as well as frequency of words in each file and any appropriate message that you think should be displayed.
• Do also produce exceptions where applicable. The program should not crash and display relevant messages for each scenario, Robustness of the program must also be guaranteed.
